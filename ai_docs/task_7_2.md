# Task 7.2: Advanced Reporting

## Goal
Develop features for generating reports and analytics based on application and voting data, providing insights into funding trends and board decisions.

## Plan
1.  Identify key reporting metrics.
2.  Design API endpoints for data aggregation.
3.  Implement frontend components for data visualization.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Reporting Requirements Definition
*   [ ] Identify key metrics and reports needed (e.g., number of applications over time, approval rates by department, average costs).
*   [ ] Determine the data sources required for each report.

### Phase 2: Backend Data Aggregation
*   [ ] Implement new backend API endpoints to query and aggregate data for the defined reports.
*   [ ] Optimize database queries for performance when dealing with large datasets.
*   [ ] Consider using specialized reporting libraries or tools if complex aggregations are required.

### Phase 3: Frontend Data Visualization
*   [ ] Choose a suitable frontend charting or data visualization library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js, Recharts).
*   [ ] Develop new React components to display the aggregated data visually (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, pie charts).
*   [ ] Implement interactive elements (e.g., date range selectors, filters) to allow users to customize reports.

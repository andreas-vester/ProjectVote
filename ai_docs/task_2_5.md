# Task 2.5: Frontend Routing

## Goal
Implement client-side routing to navigate between different views of the application (e.g., application form, voting form, archive view) using a suitable routing library.

## Plan
1.  Choose a frontend routing library.
2.  Define routes for each main application view.
3.  Implement navigation mechanisms within the application.

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Routing Library Setup
*   [ ] Select a client-side routing library for React (e.g., `react-router-dom`).
*   [ ] Install and configure the routing library in the frontend project.

### Phase 2: Route Definition
*   [ ] Define routes for the main application views:
    *   Application Submission Form (e.g., `/submit`)
    *   Token-Based Voting Form (e.g., `/vote/:token`)
    *   Application Archive View (e.g., `/archive`)
*   [ ] Map each route to its corresponding React component.

### Phase 3: Navigation Implementation
*   [ ] Implement navigation links or buttons within the application's UI to allow users to switch between different views.
*   [ ] Utilize the routing library's navigation features (e.g., `Link` component, `useNavigate` hook) for programmatic navigation.
*   [ ] Ensure that direct URL access to defined routes works correctly.
